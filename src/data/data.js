    review:"The importance of seeing clearly, of peering into oneself and the larger world with depth and discernment, is at the heart of a story marked by its own peculiar intensity of vision. (Andrew Droz Palermo composed the film’s exquisite images; the intricate but never ostentatious sets and costumes were designed by Jade Healy and Malgosia Turzanska, respectively.) Tellingly, when we first meet Gawain, he’s being yanked out of a deep slumber, not for the last time in a movie that plays like a series of rude awakenings. The one rousing him this time is his lover, Essel (Alicia Vikander), in a brothel on Christmas morning. “Christ is born,” she says, and the invocation lingers; like so many Arthurian legends, “The Green Knight” bears witness as an old world of pagan rites gives way to a rising tide of Christian belief.Gawain, whom Patel inhabits even more assuredly than he did David Copperfield, himself incarnates that religio-cultural tension. He is the nephew of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere (Kate Dickey) and a privileged guest at their Christmas celebration. But in one of a few key deviations from the original text, Gawain is also the son of the enchantress Morgan le Fay (Sarita Choudhury), whose determination to secure his future sets the story in motion. We see her cunning hand at work as Arthur’s Christmas festivities are interrupted by the Green Knight (Ralph Ineson), who turns up like the evil fairy crashing Sleeping Beauty’s christening.Evil, however, is not the name of this visitor’s game. Riding in on horseback and bearing aloft a leafy scepter, he’s an imposing Treebeard-like figure, but his eyes, gleaming out from a gnarled trunk of a face, carry more mischief than malice. (The Middle-earth echoes are fitting: J.R.R. Tolkien famously translated “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight” himself, and Weta Digital, known for its work on “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, handled this movie’s beautifully spare visual effects.) The Green Knight challenges those present to a game, inviting anyone to strike him, on the condition that one year later they will reunite at the distant Green Chapel, where the challenger will be dealt the same blow in return. Gawain impulsively accepts, swings a sword and decapitates the Green Knight — who in turn rises from the floor, calmly retrieves his head and leaves, reminding Gawain that they will reunite in one year.Before long that year is nearly spent, and Gawain, with a mighty ax in hand and a magically protective green sash tied around his waist, ventures forth to confront his uncertain destiny. Will he lose his head, or is the Green Knight’s bark worse than his smite? That’s just one question that lingers over this solemn hero’s quest, in which long stretches of solitude alternate with beguiling and sinister encounters. There are wily thieves and spectral maidens, wandering giants and a persistently friendly fox. The splendid supporting players include Barry Keoghan, Erin Kellyman, Helena Browne and Joel Edgerton, whose voice takes on a lovely, almost musical lilt in the role of a kindly lord who welcomes Gawain into a castle full of secrets.",
