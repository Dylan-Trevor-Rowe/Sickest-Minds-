# Sickest Minds

Sickest Minds is a Full CRUD, responsive application that I built as a portfolio piece. It is an evergoing ongoing work in progress.
The Application was built with movie nerds (me) in mind. 

# Overview

A user has the ability to search and view info for any movie via the Movie DataBase Api. They can favorite movies of their choosing and
build a collection of their own. They can view all the info for each favorited movie. The user also has the ability to write reviews for any favorite movie. 
Favorites and reviews are of course Full CRUD.
