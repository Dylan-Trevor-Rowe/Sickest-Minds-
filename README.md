# Sickest Minds

Sickest Minds is a Full CRUD, responsive application that I built as a portfolio piece. It is an evergoing ongoing work in progress.
The Application was built with movie nerds (me) in mind. 

# Overview

A user can log in to the application and begin by searching for a movie. I used The Move Database api for asynchronous search functionionality. 
A user can search for any film they please. A user has the ability to see the information of eached movie that pops up in the search (overview, release date, etc ).
A user can then favorite a movie. All of the users favorited movies will render into the favorites component ( favorites view ).
The user can check out additional info about a movie once it is favorited. There is an option on each card to view info. 
A user can delete their favorites at will. Once a movie has been favorited, the user can then write a review for the movie. 
After the user has written a review it can be viewed in the reviewed movies page or the sites homepage. 
The user can then update, or delete each individual movie at their will.
